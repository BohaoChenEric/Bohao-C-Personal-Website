What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? 
-The most challenging part of this task was making sure the site was both visually appealing and functional without using libraries like JavaScript or Bootstrap. I found it difficult to manage the layout and design components using only basic HTML and CSS. Setting up the structure using HTML and CSS was relatively simple, but styling the elements using CSS to meet all the project standards took more time than expected, especially if the CSS file was a standalone file.

Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
-With more time, I would like to add custom icons and a dynamic project gallery that could expand on hover or include more detailed information about each project. Iâ€™d also explore more advanced CSS animations and transitions to make the user interactions more engaging. 

How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
-I spent around 8 hours on this assignment, with the time divided between designing the layout, writing the HTML and CSS code, testing for responsiveness, and fixing layout issues.
